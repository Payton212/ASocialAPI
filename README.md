## A SocialMedia Api
this is an api that I created from scratch that uses mongoDB to set store update and delete users thoughts and reactions, each of these has a one to many relationship.
A user can have many thoughts and a thought can have many reactions, I enjoyed creating this project to further my knowledge of mongo Db at this moment on time I can say I enjoy mongo
more than some of the other databases.
